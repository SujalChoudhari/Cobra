# Cobra

A simple, object-oriented, C-style language designed for **creative coding and graphics**, built as an interpreter with
.NET and ANTLR4.

## ‚ö° Major Vision Update

Cobra is pivoting from its web-oriented goals to become a language focused on **graphics, visualization, and real-time
rendering**. The new long-term goal is to make Cobra a single, easy-to-use language for both logic and visual output.

- Instead of interfacing with complex graphics APIs, developers will write everything in Cobra.
- The language will be tightly integrated with a **built-in 2D/3D rendering engine**, allowing developers to create
  visuals, animations, and simulations with minimal boilerplate.
- This means Cobra isn‚Äôt just an interpreter‚Äîit‚Äôs a foundation for a self-contained **creative coding ecosystem**.

The project started as a native-code LLVM compiler, then became a general-purpose interpreter, and is now evolving into
a specialized tool for artists, designers, and developers interested in graphics.

## ‚ú® Features at a Glance

Cobra packs modern language features into a clean, C-style syntax.

```csharp
// Built-in standard library for core types
import "System/Exception";

// Enums with assigned values
enum State {
    Idle,       // 0
    Running,    // 1
    Paused = 10,
    Finished    // 11
}

// Rich numeric types
i8 health = 100;
f32 speed = 1.5;
u64 score = 10000;

// Metaprogramming constants for logging
void log(string message) {
    print(__FILE__ + ":" + __LINE__ + " [" + __FUNC__ + "]: " + message);
}

void processState(State currentState) {
    log("Processing current state.");

    if (currentState == State.Running) {
        // ...
    } else if (currentState == State.Idle) {
        throw new System.Exception("Cannot process Idle state!");
    }
}

// Rich error handling with stack traces
try {
    processState(State.Idle);
} catch (System.Exception e) {
    print("Caught expected error: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

## About The Project

Cobra is an educational project for learning about interpreters and language design. It parses `.cb` files using an
ANTLR-generated parser and evaluates them with a C# interpreter. The language supports procedural and object-oriented
paradigms, making it flexible for scripting complex logic and structuring graphics-related code.

### Built With

* [.NET 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
* [ANTLR4](https://www.antlr.org/) for parsing

## ‚úÖ Progress

The core interpreter is functional and feature-rich.

*   [x] Variable and constant declarations (`var`, `const`)
*   [x] Primitive types (`bool`, `string`, `handle`)
*   [x] **Expanded numeric types** (`i8`-`i64`, `u8`-`u64`, `f32`, `f64`)
*   [x] Expression evaluation (arithmetic, logical, bitwise) with type promotion
*   [x] Control Flow (`if-else`, `switch-case`)
*   [x] Looping (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, `foreach`)
*   [x] Function declarations and calls
*   [x] **Enum declarations** with assignable values
*   [x] **Object-Oriented Programming**
    *   [x] Class definitions
    *   [x] Constructors and destructors
    *   [x] Access modifiers (`public`, `private`)
    *   [x] Static members
    *   [x] Instance context (`this`)
*   [x] Array and Dictionary literals
*   [x] Namespaces and module imports (`import "path/to/file"`)
*   [x] Native FFI (`link`, `external`)
*   [x] **Error Handling** (`try-catch-finally`, `throw`)
*   [x] **Rich runtime error reporting** (stack traces with source code snippets)
*   [x] **Metaprogramming constants** (`__FILE__`, `__LINE__`, `__FUNC__`)
*   [ ] Expand standard library
    *   [ ] Math library (vector, matrix, trig)
    *   [ ] Utility libraries (random, string, etc.)
    *   [ ] File I/O
*   [ ] Expose high-level graphics API
*   [ ] Implement ‚ÄúCobra Canvas‚Äù for simple windowed drawing

## üöÄ Why This Matters

The ultimate goal is to **lower the barrier to entry for creative coding and graphics programming**. By integrating a
powerful rendering engine directly into an easy-to-learn language, Cobra aims to:

- **Simplify Graphics**: Abstract away the complexity of modern graphics APIs.
- **Unify Logic and Rendering**: Allow developers to write game logic, simulations, and rendering code in one seamless
  language.
- **Enable Rapid Prototyping**: Create a fun and interactive environment for quickly bringing visual ideas to life.

### üêç Clone the Project

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SujalChoudhari/Cobra.git
   cd Cobra
   ```

### ü§ù Contributor Workflow

- The project has a functional core interpreter! The foundation is solid.
- New feature branches and PRs are welcome for:
    - Expanding the standard library with math or utility functions.
    - Improving the type system (e.g., static analysis).
    - Beginning work on the graphics API.
- Thanks to the new detailed stack traces, debugging runtime issues is easier than ever.

#### Suggested Steps:

1. **Create your own branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <feature-or-bugfix-name>
   ```
2. **Start work:**
   Add new interpreter code, tests, or documentation.
3. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Short but clear summary of your changes"
   ```
4. **Push your branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin <your-branch-name>
   ```
5. **Open a Pull Request on GitHub.**
    - Briefly describe what you implemented or fixed.

But the underlying code is majorly written by Gemini and verified by me.
