# Cobra

A simple, object-oriented, C-style language designed for **creative coding and graphics**, built as an interpreter with .NET and ANTLR4.

## ‚ö° Major Vision Update

Cobra is pivoting from its web-oriented goals to become a language focused on **graphics, visualization, and real-time rendering**. The new long-term goal is to make Cobra a single, easy-to-use language for both logic and visual output.

-   Instead of interfacing with complex graphics APIs, developers will write everything in Cobra.
-   The language will be tightly integrated with a **built-in 2D/3D rendering engine**, allowing developers to create visuals, animations, and simulations with minimal boilerplate.
-   This means Cobra isn‚Äôt just an interpreter‚Äîit‚Äôs a foundation for a self-contained **creative coding ecosystem**.

The project started as a native-code LLVM compiler, then became a general-purpose interpreter, and is now evolving into a specialized tool for artists, designers, and developers interested in graphics.

## About The Project

Cobra is an educational project for learning about interpreters and language design. It parses `.cb` files using an ANTLR-generated parser and evaluates them with a C# interpreter. The language supports procedural and object-oriented paradigms, making it flexible for scripting complex logic and structuring graphics-related code.

### Built With

*   [.NET 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
*   [ANTLR4](https://www.antlr.org/) for parsing
*   [CommandLineParser](https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline) for CLI handling

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### Core Syntax & Semantics
- **Variable & Constant Declarations**: `var`, `const`.
- **Primitive Data Types**: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, `handle`.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Full support for arithmetic, logical, and bitwise operators with correct precedence.
- **Functions**: First-class function declarations and calls.

### Control Flow
- **Conditional Logic**: `if-else` statements.
- **Looping**: `for`, `while`, `do-while`, and `foreach` loops.
- **Branching**: `switch-case` statements.
- **Jump Statements**: `return`, `break`, `continue`.

### Object-Oriented Programming
- **Classes**: `class` definitions for encapsulating data and behavior.
- **Constructors & Destructors**: `constructor` for initialization and `destructor` for manual cleanup via the `destroy()` function.
- **Access Modifiers**: `public` and `private` members.
- **Static Members**: `static` fields and methods for class-level data and functionality.
- **Instance Context**: The `this` keyword for accessing the current object instance.

### Data Structures
- **Array Literals**: e.g., `[1, "two", 3.0]`
- **Dictionary Literals**: e.g., `{ key1: 10, "key2": "value" }`

### Modularity & Interoperability
- **Namespaces**: Organize code into logical blocks with `namespace`.
- **Modules**: `import` other `.cb` files.
- **Native FFI**: `link` and execute functions from native C/C++ libraries (`.dll`, `.so`) using `external`.

## üöß Roadmap & Future Goals

### Core Language Enhancements
- **Error Handling**: Implement `try-catch-finally` for robust runtime error management.
- **Improved Diagnostics**: Provide detailed runtime error messages with file names, line numbers, and code context.
- **Standard Library Expansion**:
    - **Math Library**: Add a `Math` namespace with comprehensive vector, matrix, and trigonometry functions.
    - **Utility Libraries**: Functions for color manipulation, random number generation, and noise algorithms.

### Cobra Graphics Engine
- **Rendering Backend**: Integrate a C# graphics library (like SkiaSharp for 2D or Veldrid for 3D) as the rendering backend.
- **Graphics API**: Expose a high-level Cobra API for drawing shapes, setting colors, applying transforms, and handling user input.
- **The "Cobra Canvas"**: A core goal is to enable a simple script to open a window and draw to it with just a few lines of Cobra code.
- **Event Handling**: Create a simple event loop for handling `mouse_moved`, `key_pressed`, etc.

## üöÄ Why This Matters

The ultimate goal is to **lower the barrier to entry for creative coding and graphics programming**. By integrating a powerful rendering engine directly into an easy-to-learn language, Cobra aims to:

-   **Simplify Graphics**: Abstract away the complexity of modern graphics APIs.
-   **Unify Logic and Rendering**: Allow developers to write game logic, simulations, and rendering code in one seamless language.
-   **Enable Rapid Prototyping**: Create a fun and interactive environment for quickly bringing visual ideas to life.
